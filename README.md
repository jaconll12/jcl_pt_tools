# jcl_pt_tools
playground of creating a docker image for some Pen testing tools I may need anywhere.  

This is my first docker container that has some simple pen testing tools loaded as a toolkit to take anywhere I need.

Tools are:
nmap
dirb
wfuzz
curl
wget
sqlmap
git
python3

To run the docker image run the command:
docker run -it jacoll/jcl_pt_tools
